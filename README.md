# Simple Game for Schell Games Assessment
Using Unity version 2020.3.28f1
Chose to build Pong

## Requirements:
Option 1 — Bouncing Ball Game (e.g. **Pong**, Breakout)
Option 2 — Tile-based Puzzle Game (e.g. Bejeweled, Tetris, Minesweeper)

We will be evaluating the programming aspect of your prototype, so there is no need to spend time on nice art or a unique design.
Cloning an existing game mechanic is completely acceptable, but please do not use any art or other content that you do not have the rights to use.

We are much more interested in the quality of the implementation rather than the quantity of features.
A clean and elegant version of Pong with robust physics and controls that feel really good will be much more impressive than a flaky implementation of Breakout with dozens of unique powerups and a bunch of different levels.
Your code should be clear, concise, and well-commented. 
Your sample will be evaluated as if it is part of a larger code base, so it should perform well and use an appropriate amount of memory, demonstrating best practices for scalability.

As a guideline, we expect you to spend approximately 8 hours on this task.
This is to give a sense of scope.  You are free to spend as little or as much time as you feel is necessary.

include the standalone build, source project folder, and a ReadMe file with any relevant information needed for your project.
